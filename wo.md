# Changing Guest List

You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else to invite.

-  Add a `print()` call at the end of your program, stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.
- Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting.
- Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.

# More Guests

You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is available. Think of three more guests to invite to dinner.

- Start with your program. Add a `print()` call to the end of your program, informing people that you found a bigger table.
- Use `insert()` to add one new guest to the beginning of your list.
- Use `insert()` to add one new guest to the middle of your list.
- Use `append()` to add one new guest to the end of your list.
- Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.
